## Lesson 3: Photo Resistor

> This project is set up for compilation in Visual Studio Code using the [Arduino extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino/). It should also compile in the default Arduino IDE, though some files might initially not be visible there.

An LED responding to the current ambient brightness as reported by a photo resistor.
If it's dark the LED turns on, if it's bright it turns off and if it's somewhere in between the LED is blinking constantly.
