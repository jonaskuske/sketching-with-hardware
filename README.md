# Class: Sketching mit Hardware

This repository contains the code for my university class "sketching with hardware", an introduction to working with hardware (Arduino) and C++.

> Note: The comments within the code are written in German as of now.

### Lesson 1: Traffic Control
Implementation of an automatic traffic control system, monitoring traffic with an ultrasonic sensor. Can also be controlled with an IR Remote.
> see branch: [`traffic-control`](https://github.com/jonaskuske/sketching-with-hardware/tree/traffic-control)

### Lesson 2: Blinking LED
A simple LED, controllable with a button: it eithers blinks or turns off with a fade-out effect.
> see branch: [`blinking-led`](https://github.com/jonaskuske/sketching-with-hardware/tree/blinking-led)

### Lesson 3: Photo Resistor
Using a photo resistor so an LED can respond to the ambient brightness.
> see branch: [`photo-resistor`](https://github.com/jonaskuske/sketching-with-hardware/tree/photo-resistor)

### Lesson 4: Async Control
Using the `millis` function to let one LED blink while another responds to button presses at the same time.
> see branch: [`async-control`](https://github.com/jonaskuske/sketching-with-hardware/tree/async-control)

### Lesson 5: Color Loop
Controlling the different color channels of an RBG LED, smoothly fading from one color to the next to create a rainbow effect.
> see branch: [`async-control`](https://github.com/jonaskuske/sketching-with-hardware/tree/color-loop)
