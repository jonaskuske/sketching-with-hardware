## Lesson 2: Blinking LED

> This project is set up for compilation in Visual Studio Code using the [Arduino extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino/). It should also compile in the default Arduino IDE, though some files might initially not be visible there.

A simple LED, controllable with a button.
If on (`isActive` = `true`), the LED is blinking, otherwise it turns off with a fade-out.
